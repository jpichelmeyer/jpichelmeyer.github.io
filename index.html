						Cryptology is the study of the codes and ciphers used to create secret writing. This math course explores many early techniques in cryptology, such as cipher wheels, the Caesar shift, polyalphabetic substitution, and the Vigenère cipher, as well as modern techniques like RSA public key cryptography. You and your classmates will learn how data transmitted by computers can be secured with digital encryption, and how the vulnerabilities of each encryption system enable hackers to attack and decrypt messages using techniques such as frequency analysis and cribbing. You’ll apply concepts while encrypting and decrypting your own secret messages. Though the course’s central focus is on the mathematics of cryptology, you’ll also learn the historical context of cryptography and cryptographic devices like the Enigma Machine—one of the most important cryptographic devices in history—so you develop a deep understanding of this branch of mathematics and its applications in the world.

					<div class="taught_course_tags">
						<div class="tag tag_jhu">Johns Hopkins University CTY</div>
					</div>
					<div class="taught_course_description">
						Have you ever wondered what real mathematicians spend their time doing? This course will teach you the art of proving and disproving conjectures, and techniques for writing formal proofs and counterexamples. You’ll learn key concepts of logic, including validity, soundness, consistency, and satisfiability, and techniques for developing systems of logic in formal symbolic languages. You’ll test the validity of arguments, write precise formal proofs, and explore the rules of grammar and meanings behind the symbols. Then you and your classmates will engage in the process of metalogic, or reasoning logically about a system of logic. You’ll examine soundness and completeness, and along the way, you’ll become proficient at writing proofs accurately and rigorously, a skill essential to career mathematicians. Most importantly, you’ll develop strong problem-solving skills and learn to think analytically—traits vital for rigorous inquiry in any field.</div>

					<div class="taught_course_title">Topology</div>
					<div class="taught_course_tags">
						<div class="tag tag_jhu">Johns Hopkins University CTY</div>
					</div>
					<div class="taught_course_description">
						Topology is the mathematical study of shapes and space that considers questions such as, “What objects that visually seem quite different share the same properties?” One of the major fields of mathematics, topology possesses wide-ranging applications and beautiful theorems with far-reaching consequences. This course will introduce you and your classmates to point-set topology as you delve into bizarre notions of "space" and develop skills with rigorous, proof-based mathematics. You’ll begin by tackling the core concepts of sets, topologies, and continuous mappings before moving on to topological invariants such as compactness, connectedness, and the separation axioms. With these tools in hand, you will explore how to deform shapes and spaces without altering their fundamental properties. This knowledge allows you to see why it took 100 years for mathematicians to prove Poincaré’s 1904 conjecture about the nature of a sphere. Finally, you’ll survey different applications of topology, such as how the study of knots influenced our understanding of proteins, or how the study of manifolds led scientists to a deeper understanding of the topological shape of the universe.

				As a pure mathematician, my research focused on low-dimensional geometric topology and knot theory. I was mentored by <a href="https://www.math.ksu.edu/~dav/">Dave Auckley</a> and <a href="https://www.math.ksu.edu/~sadykov/">Rustam Sadykov</a> at Kansas State University and am deeply appreciative of their time, conversation, and friendship.
